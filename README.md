The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an AI-powered company chatbot that securely authenticates company users, processes company-related documentation, and provides accurate, context-aware responses to employee queries in a conversational manner.

The specific objectives are:
Secure User Authentication:

To implement a QR code-based authentication system that ensures only verified employees can access the chatbot platform.
Automated Document Processing:

To enable the system to ingest PDF documents containing company details (such as HR policies, salary structures, perks, healthcare insurance, and more) and automatically tokenize and process the data.
Vector Embedding and Efficient Storage:

To vectorize the document content and store it efficiently using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast semantic search and retrieval of information.
Natural Language Query Understanding:

To integrate a robust NLP model that can accurately understand and interpret user queries, both for informational requests and general conversational interactions.
Intelligent Answer Generation:

To retrieve relevant data from the FAISS vector store and generate clear, concise, and context-aware responses for employee queries.
Seamless User Interaction:

To create a chatbot interface that can handle both formal queries (related to policies, salary, perks, etc.) and informal conversations (small talk and general interaction) for better user engagement.
